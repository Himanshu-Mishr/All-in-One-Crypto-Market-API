### Usage
Example calls:

localhost:11644/api/**bitfinex**/**usd**

Replace `bitfinex` with any other available market to see their datas.

```JSON
{
    "ask": "4278.5",
    "bid": "4278.4",
    "last": "4278.5",
    "volume": "30272.21365286",
    "high": "4439.9",
    "low": "4210.1"
}```





localhost:11644/api/**bitfinex**/**ltcbtc**

Replace `ltcbtc` with any other correct values, for example `/api/bitfinex/neobtc` will **not** work due to neo is not a correct call on bitfinex market.
```JSON
{
    "ask": "0.012076",
    "bid": "0.012069",
    "last": "0.01207",
    "volume": "65134.1915878",
    "high": "0.012234",
    "low": "0.012004"
}```





localhost:11644/api/**all**/**fiat**

Returns **__BTC-FIAT__** datas in json. Markets with original pair different than `USD` will be returned in original currency, like as `btcturk` in this example. An extra `pair` is also returned with these type of markets.
```JSON
{
    "bitfinex": {
        "ask": "4283.4",
        "bid": "4283.3",
        "last": "4283.4",
        "volume": "30143.3918181",
        "high": "4439.9",
        "low": "4210.1"
    },
    "bitstamp": {
        "ask": "4274.99",
        "bid": "4274.53",
        "last": "4274.99",
        "volume": "12979.77900300",
        "high": "4425.00",
        "low": "4218.00"
    },
    "cexio": {
        "ask": "4324.8399",
        "bid": "4318.0653",
        "last": "4324.84",
        "volume": "1097.24535895",
        "high": "4480",
        "low": "4260.1629"
    },
    "btcturk": {
        "ask": "15200",
        "bid": "15158,56",
        "last": "15158,57",
        "volume": "152,81",
        "high": "15371,99",
        "low": "15100",
        "pair": "TRY"
    }
}```




For the **USD** equations of all markets available in the API, use **__/api/all/usd__**

localhost:11644/api/**all**/**usd**
```JSON
same as above example, but for btcturk, output will be:
"btcturk": {
        "ask": "4248,6",
        "bid": "4241,7",
        "last": "4241,7",
        "volume": "152,24",
        "high": "4282,4",
        "low": "4213,7",
        "pair": "USD"
    }
```
